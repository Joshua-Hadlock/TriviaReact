            <h1 className="aboutH1">McQuackers</h1>
            <p>We believe that everyone is secretly a genius and we thought that the best way to prove that is 
              to unlock hidden knowledge in their head. Originally a school project two high school students by 
              the name of Joshua Hadlock and Isaac Tellez created McQuackers. When we asked the creator of the 
              brand name why he chose McQuackers he just said "Well it was just the first thing that came to mind"
